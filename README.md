# JWT Auth Frontend

[Frontend Auth Instructions](./instructions.md)

The purpose of the app is to create a platform for a community of auto enthusiasts looking for people that share their interest, buy or sell "whips" and to be able to easily find the niche mechanics that work on vintage and super cars. It will also provide an avenue to participate in events and shows in your locale or around the world.

The existing apps like Carfax are more focused on commerce rather than community. Most focus on only one or other aspect while "Wits & Whhels" is focused on creating a community while encompassing all the other features in one app. And therefore making it easy for enthusiasts to share their passion for cars.
